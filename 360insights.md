**START RECEIVED**

Surprise! This is not a Neighborhood Tour.

You’ve heard of Escape Rooms. Now you’re stepping into the world’s first Break-In Room Game.

You’re “locked out” of the NOLA Office (717 St. Charles Ave). Your mission is to use the neighborhood to solve the clues, uncover the secret password, and get back inside.

And no, you’re not really locked out. Stop by anytime if you need a restroom, or if you just plain give up.

Let's start easy. What word is lit up over the bar in the New Orleans office?

**INSIGHTS RECEIVED**

DING! DING! DING! Don’t worry. It gets harder. Are there any Hamilton fans on your team? The founding father, not the Tiger-Cats. Head over to the Square named for America’s favorite fighting Frenchman. Google it if you must. AFTER you get there, tell me his name.
